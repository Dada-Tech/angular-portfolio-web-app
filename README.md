## Intro
I built this project to exercise and solidify my full stack knowledge as well as creating a developer portfolio. This is to show the inner workings of my portfolio as I may not be releasing all of the content on GitHub.

## Technologies used
* Angular8
* Bootstrap 4
* SCSS  
   
The front end of this project is a Single-Page-Application built with Angular 8.
Bootstrap 4 was used to achieve responsive views for mobile, tablet, and any size web browser.  
For more advanced customization I used SCSS which allowed me to leverage nested syntax, mixins, and variables.

#
