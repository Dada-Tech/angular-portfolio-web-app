# Dada Legacy Portfolio Web-App
##### Detailed Writeup - [Portfolio Gist](https://gist.github.com/Dada-Tech/4d651450e20f1267ce77dc26981ad7a3)
  
## Intro
I built this project to exercise and solidify my full stack knowledge as well as creating a developer portfolio. This is to show the inner workings of my portfolio as I may not be releasing all of the content on GitHub.

## Technologies used
* Angular 2+ - Single page application
* Bootstrap - Tailwind-like streamlined styling
* SCSS - For more advanced styling
* Firebase - Cloud Services for security, quickdevelopment, scalability
* Firestore (NoSQL DB) - for Database backed contact form
* Node - Backend Server
* Express - Backend Server API
* Captcha v3 - Security middleware, prevents spam/bots
* Security Middleware (CORS, input validation) - Additional backend security
* CMS - Dynamically update Portfolio projects without touching code
* Wordpress API - Leveraging this API as a CMS
* RESTful Web Services - concept behind the CMS API

   
The front end of this project is a Single-Page-Application built with Angular 2+.
Bootstrap was used to achieve responsive views for mobile, tablet, and any size web browser.  
For more advanced customization I used SCSS which allowed me to leverage nested syntax, mixins, and variables.

# 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.

## Install

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
