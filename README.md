## Intro
I built this project to exercise and solidify my full stack knowledge as well as creating a developer portfolio. This is to show the inner workings of my portfolio as I may not be releasing all of the content on GitHub.

## Technologies used
* Angular 2+
* Bootstrap
* SCSS  
   
The front end of this project is a Single-Page-Application built with Angular 2+.
Bootstrap was used to achieve responsive views for mobile, tablet, and any size web browser.  
For more advanced customization I used SCSS which allowed me to leverage nested syntax, mixins, and variables.

# 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.2.

## Install
Run `npm install` to install dependencies 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
