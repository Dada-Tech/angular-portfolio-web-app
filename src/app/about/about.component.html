            <br>
            I like to think of my skill set as a Swiss Army knife which means that I have a wide variety of skills and many applications for them.
            <br><br>
            Picking up programming has allowed me to apply my passion for problem-solving and
            building things to be able to solve real-world problems and needs.

            Looking towards the future, I really do believe that programming and especially
            Artificial Intelligence will continue to drive innovation; I want to be part of that innovation.
            <br><br>
            This is one of the major reasons why I've decided to pursue even more education in Computer Science.

            I also know the importance of mentorship. However clich√©, I would not be
            where I am today without the help and quality advice of my mentors.
            <br><br>
            In the same vein, I also mentor people who are passionate about programming and are
            a eager to learn. This is one of the reasons why I often bring students and junior
            developers on to my freelance projects.

            As the typical Millennial Entrepreneur, I'm a big fan of self-improvement.
             When I'm not programming I'm looking for ways to improve myself in terms of
            health, wealth and the quality of relationships I have with my friends and family.
            <br><br>
            And of course because life isn't just about the
            relentless pursuit of success, money, and greatness I do also kick back
            with hobbies that I have for pure enjoyment: hiking, language learning and playing guitar.
